### Steps Followed

- **Step 1:** Load data into Power BI Desktop from various sources including CSV files  .
- **Step 2:** Open Power Query Editor to clean and transform the data. Enable "Column distribution," "Column quality," and "Column profile" options under the View tab.
- **Step 3:** Ensure column profiling is based on the entire dataset.
- **Step 4:** Identify the relationships between these entities. For example, such as Bookings, Aggregated Bookings, Dates, Rooms, and Revenue.

- **Step 5:** Define relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys. Ensure referential integrity is maintained.
- **Step 6:** Used the "Manage Relationships" tool in Power BI to establish these connections.
- **Step 7:** Use card visuals to display key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, average daily rate (ADR), and RevPAR.

- **Step 8:** Select a suitable theme for the report under the View tab in the report view.
- **Step 9:** Add key visuals to represent various metrics. For example, use bar charts for Realisation % by metrics, line charts for trends over time, and Donut charts for Revenue by Category.
- **Step 10:** Add slicers for fields like "City", "Room Type", "months" and "Week No" to enable interactive filtering.
- **Step 11:** Create calculated columns and measures using DAX to derive additional insights. For example, calculating RevPAR as follows:


  ```DAX
  1) RevPAR = [Total Revenue] / [Total Available Rooms]

  
  2) Revpar WoW change % =
  VAR selv =
  IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),   
  SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),
  MAX(dim_date[wn]))

  VAR revcw =
  CALCULATE([RevPAR], dim_date[wn]= selv)

  var revpw =
  CALCULATE([RevPAR], FILTER(ALL(dim_date), dim_date[wn]=selv-1))
  
  return

  DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1

- **Step 13:**  Add the company's logo and tagline for branding purposes.
- **Step 14:**  Publish the report to Power BI Service for easy sharing and collaboration.
